# Ellis Poling — Academic Website (Jekyll)

This is a lightweight academic website for GitHub Pages.

## Quick Start
1. Create a GitHub repo named `ellispoling.github.io`.
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo root.
3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment** and select:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` and folder `/ (root)`
4. Wait ~1–2 minutes. Your site will be live at https://ellispoling.github.io

## Update Content
- Edit the page `.md` files (e.g., `index.md`, `research.md`) directly in GitHub.
- Replace placeholder PDFs in `assets/docs/` (keep filenames to avoid breaking links).
- Replace `assets/images/profile.jpg` with your headshot (120x120+ recommended).

## Customize Styles
- Colors and styles are in `assets/css/style.css`.
- Site title and navigation are in `_config.yml`.
